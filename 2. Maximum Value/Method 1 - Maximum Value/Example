Step 1: User Input
Prompt the user to input numbers separated by spaces. For example:

Enter numbers separated by spaces: 60 50 95 80 70

Step 2: Convert Input to a List
Split the input string and convert each element to an integer.

Input: "60 50 95 80 70"

After conversion:
[60, 50, 95, 80, 70]

Step 3: Bubble Sort Approach
We aim to find the maximum value by gradually moving the largest number to the end of the list through pairwise comparisons.

      Initial List:
      [60, 50, 95, 80, 70]

      Iteration 1:
      Compare 60 and 50 → Swap → [50, 60, 95, 80, 70]
      Compare 60 and 95 → No Swap → [50, 60, 95, 80, 70]
      Compare 95 and 80 → Swap → [50, 60, 80, 95, 70]
      Compare 95 and 70 → Swap → [50, 60, 80, 70, 95]
      Largest number 95 is now at the last position.

      Iteration 2:
      Compare 50 and 60 → No Swap → [50, 60, 80, 70, 95]
      Compare 60 and 80 → No Swap → [50, 60, 80, 70, 95]
      Compare 80 and 70 → Swap → [50, 60, 70, 80, 95]

      Iteration 3:
      Compare 50 and 60 → No Swap → [50, 60, 70, 80, 95]
      Compare 60 and 70 → No Swap → [50, 60, 70, 80, 95]

      Iteration 4:
      Compare 50 and 60 → No Swap → [50, 60, 70, 80, 95]

Step 4: Maximum Value
After sorting, the largest number is at the last index of the list:
Max Value = 95
